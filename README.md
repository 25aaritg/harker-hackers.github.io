# About
Harker Hackers is a group of Harker Middle school students dedicated to building useful student software, established January 2021. Since then, we have released a variety of projects. We build tools to improve our peer's everyday school life using technology. We hope to soon have some of our services pushed as official school solutions. We encourage people who love to innovate and serve to join our team!

Founded by Aarav Borthakur and Aarush Vailaya.

In February, they added their first member, Aarit Gupta. He is good at graphics and photo editing and has made the logo for Harker Hackers and the icon for the extension. He does most of thhe graphics for the team but also uses python fluently. His first project is to make a python script that automatically joins zoom meetings so that students can't forget the timing.
